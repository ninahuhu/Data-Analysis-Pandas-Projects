In this project, we utilize pandas for comprehensive data cleaning tasks on the 'Customer Call List.xlsx' dataset. This includes removing duplicates, dropping unnecessary columns, applying string manipulation functions (such as stripping), standardizing phone numbers, splitting address columns, replacing and filling null values, filtering data rows, and creating new indices.
